# Learning-based-path-planner

This is the open-source code for the article: Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenario with Learning-based Network and Optimization method. The repo mainly includes two module: path planning and speed planning. The code is being sorted out and will be uploaded successively


Path planning:

1. The enviroment is running on Python 3.7 with pytorch 1.2. If developer has not pytorch, it's recommended that you use the ground truth generated by A*, which can run directly.
command: 
       python gui.py

2. The training network is located in segmentation networks which developers can test the performance of prediction. You can train and eval by yourself.
run: 
      python main_nagivation_prediction.py

Note that due to the requirements for business cooperation, the open-source code of path planning is rebuiled on Python. Its running speed will be lower than the C++ version. Interested developers can write their own in C++ according to the open source code. 

Speed planning:
In order to visually show the effect of vehicle speed planning, the related program is integrated in the Qt with C++. 
Dependency:  
1. osqp 0.4.0 (Pay attention to the version, otherwise an error will be reported);
2. Qcustomplot.
